                 <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; color: brown">Software Engineer Major / Emperor of the South China Sea</p>
                <p>I am a Software Engineering student at Iowa State
                 University, and secondarily an owner of a Fortune 500 Company SuperCode
                  from my lucrative accomplishments through computer science, philantropy, adventure capitalism, 
                   and chemical warfare.
                   <br>This summer I will be working at Principal Financials as a Software Engineering Intern.

                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>The first project I have ever coded was a intense and extensive 
                    hacking software which breaks any firewall and automatically puts
                    you into the mainframe of any MacOS, Linux, or Windows machine.
                    <br><br>
                    Breaching the world of cyberdefense, my program allowed the citizens of the United States to 
                    break into Fort Knox and grant equal wealth to their impoverished communities. Many world leaders
                    have recognized this breach as a Robin Hood act of valient courage, care, and incredible skill.
                    <br><br>
                    An additional accomplishment of this project was the internal takeover of the International Space Station
                    to implement the defense laser system to give those below a laser light show which increased raves 
                    by 10,240.4% and solved the issue of world peace and world hunger.
                    <br><br>
                    Completing this for the Department of Defense has allowed me to 
                    recieve the honor of being Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor at Hogwarts
                    School for talented wizards, witches, and coders.

                    <h3>Project 2</h3>
                    <p>The project that mades me the envy of all aspiring computer scientists
                        was my work on the Hello World project. This project, funded by the 
                        International Peace Core, is a complicated systematic design that
                        from a high level language is compiled through a Python IDE to
                        a machine-readable language, enters multiple data sources into 
                        a multi-registered system through the CPU using the compiled 
                        instructional binary. Then, the data from the registers, set 
                        strategically by my program, is outputted on a pixeled digital screen
                        which can be read by users to greet them into the world of code.
                        <br><br>
                        Some of the many prestegious awards I have received for this project
                        are below.
